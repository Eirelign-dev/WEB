  <meta property="og:description" content="At Éirelign, we believe that every detail in a golfer’s setup should reflect pride, precision, and personality — right down to the alignment sticks.
Founded in Dublin, Ireland, Éirelign was born out of a simple frustration: the alignment sticks on the market were generic, plastic, and uninspired. As passionate golfers ourselves, we took pride in how our bags looked and felt. But when it came to alignment sticks — a crucial tool for practice, posture, and swing consistency — the options just didn’t cut it.
So, we set out to change that.
We craft premium wooden golf alignment sticks, each one thoughtfully designed and painted to bring character and quality back to your golf gear. Our sticks aren’t just tools — they’re statements. Durable, elegant, and rooted in Irish craftsmanship, Éirelign sticks are made for golfers who care about both performance and style.
Whether you're working on your swing plane, ball position, or short game drills, our alignment sticks are built to support your journey — with a touch of artistry that sets you apart on the course.
This is golf gear with soul. This is Éirelign.." />
